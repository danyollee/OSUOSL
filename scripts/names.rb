# Class for calculating weighted scores
#
# To use: instantiate this class with an array of 10 scores corresponding to the
# names list, and call the output method.
#
# For each person in the names list with a score greater than or equal
# to 5 this code should do the following:
#
# 1. Calculate their weighted score, which is (215 + average score) / score
#
# For example, if the average score is 10 and one person's score is 12,
# their weighted score is
#
# (215 + 10)/12 = 225/12 = 18.0
#
# 2. Print out the name, corresponding email and weighted score on a line.
# Number each line, starting at 1, so that the output looks something like
# this:
#
#	 1. Name, email, W = weighted_score
#	 2. Name, email, W = weighted_score
#	 3. Name, email, W = weighted_score
#	 .
#	 .
#	 etc
